                <h1>Welcome back to Oberlin</h1>
                <p>
                    "So, what does it feel like to be back?'
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I came back from 2 years of leave of absence, this is what my friend asked me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Well, things have not changed that much."
                </p>

                    After my first year at Oberlin, I had to leave school and go back to Korea to fulfill my duty as a Korean citizen. All Korean males are obligated to serve in the military for two years, and I had to finish my service when I had a chance. Two years in the army was not that bad. I was assigned a position of a drill instructor and spent my time teaching young recruit soldiers how to shoot rifles and throw grenades.

                    When I came back to Oberlin, I had to face so many different changes. All of my first-year friends became fourth-year students who were getting ready for their graduation, and the clean first-year only dormitory was no longer available for me. However, the campus was still the same. I could feel the cold breeze of Ohio, and I could appreciate how the campus loses its color as soon as winter came.

                    Yet, I had to leave again. In March 2020, due to the COVID outbreak, all the students had to vacate the campus. I can still remember the day that decision was made. One night, an email was delivered to students noticing that one of the staff members at the dining hall was diagnosed positive, and the following email contained a message that students have to leave their dorm by the week after. I had to fly back to South Korea again, and spend a year taking online courses.

                    After taking a painful semester through online courses, I decided to take another year off and get a job in Korea. The coronavirus was still a big threat around the world, and I thought staying in my home country would be a safer choice. During the additional leave of absence, I had moved to three different companies and mostly worked as a software engineer.

                    When every memory I had of the academia felt like a dream, the time of comeback had come. I had to fly back to a small city in Ohio to finish my bachelor's degree. As much as I was worried about going back to college, I was excited that I could finally leave the building forest and go back to the ivory tower. The moment I came back to Oberlin, I could appreciate something I could not before. A pure passion and creativity of students and faculty was full of inspiration and life, and merged with it, a beautiful and peaceful nature of the Oberlin campus created a unique atmosphere. Even though buildings and scenary has not changed, and I knew that this  lovely weather would disappear very soon and the campus would lose its color, but such homeostasis was also something that made me feel like I came back home. So if you ask how it feels to be back after all those years, even though everyone I knew had graduated, I would say,
                </p>
                <p>
                    "It's good to be back."
